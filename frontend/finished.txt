#install postgres locally, and connect to it, even if it's in docker. I don't care. just install it, connect, seed the data in there, turn on the endpoint, hook it up to the frontend, NPM run 

#this app will be finished, when 
1. backend/api/ will turn on, run through all test. spin up a postgres database for testing. 
2. IT will migrate the databse, seed the database, 
3. The frontend features, will all be hooked up to the backend apis. the todos_checklist.txt will all be completed. 
4. All features and functionality in the frontend will test, because they will be fed by seeded data in the backend api. 
5. Need to create a plan to get closer and closer to that.
