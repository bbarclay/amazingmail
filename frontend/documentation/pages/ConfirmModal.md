## Overview
The Confirm Modal is a reusable component in AmazingMail that provides a standardized way to ask users for confirmation before performing critical actions. It enhances user experience by preventing accidental actions and maintaining consistency across the application.

## Current Status
- [x] Basic UI implementation
- [ ] Full functionality implementation
- [ ] Integration with other components
- [ ] Testing

## Features

### Implemented Features
- [x] Modal dialog with customizable content
- [x] Confirm and Cancel buttons

### Pending Features
- [ ] Customizable button labels
- [ ] Optional icon or image display
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support (Esc to cancel, Enter to confirm)
- [ ] Animated entrance and exit

## Frontend Implementation

### UI Components
- [x] Modal overlay
- [x] Modal content container
- [x] Title
- [x] Message
- [x] Confirm button
- [x] Cancel button

### Functionality
- [ ] Show/hide modal
- [ ] Handle confirm action
- [ ] Handle cancel action
- [ ] Close on overlay click (optional)
- [ ] Accessibility features (focus trap, aria attributes)

## Backend Integration

### API Endpoints
N/A - This is a frontend-only component

### Data Flow
- [ ] Receive configuration props from parent components
- [ ] Pass confirmation status back to parent components

## Testing

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for modal visibility
- [ ] Unit tests for button actions
- [ ] Integration tests with parent components
- [ ] Accessibility tests

## Security Considerations
- [ ] Ensure that sensitive information is not displayed in the modal content
- [ ] Implement proper input sanitization if modal content is dynamically generated

## UI/UX Suggestions
- [ ] Implement a subtle animation for modal appearance
- [ ] Use consistent styling with the rest of the application
- [ ] Ensure high contrast for text readability
- [ ] Consider adding a visual indicator for destructive actions (e.g., red color for delete confirmations)

## Roadmap
1. Implement basic show/hide functionality
2. Add customizable button labels and icons
3. Implement keyboard navigation and accessibility features
4. Add animation for improved user experience
5. Conduct user testing and gather feedback for further improvements

## Business Analyst Perspective
The Confirm Modal is a critical UI component that helps prevent user errors and improves the overall user experience of AmazingMail. By providing a consistent confirmation interface across the application, we can reduce support tickets related to accidental actions and increase user confidence. Prioritize the implementation of this component early in the development process to ensure it can be easily integrated into all necessary parts of the application.

## Dependencies
- Frontend framework (Next.js)
- UI component library (if used in the project)
- Animation library (optional, for enhanced transitions)

## Performance Considerations
- Keep the modal component lightweight to ensure quick rendering
- Use lazy loading techniques if the modal includes heavy content (e.g., images)
- Optimize animation performance to maintain smooth user experience on lower-end devices

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Confirm Modal component, including its current status, required features, implementation details, testing requirements, and future roadmap. It serves as a guide for developers, designers, and project managers to understand the component's scope and priorities.
