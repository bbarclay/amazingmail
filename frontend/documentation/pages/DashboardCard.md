# Dashboard Card Documentation

## Overview
The Dashboard Card is a reusable component in AmazingMail that displays key metrics, summaries, or actionable items on the user's dashboard. It provides a quick overview of important information and allows users to navigate to more detailed views.

## Current Status
- [x] Basic UI implementation
- [ ] Full functionality implementation
- [ ] Integration with backend data
- [ ] Testing

## Features

### Implemented Features
- [x] Card container with title
- [x] Basic content display area

### Pending Features
- [ ] Dynamic data loading and display
- [ ] Interactive elements (buttons, links)
- [ ] Data visualization (charts, graphs)
- [ ] Customizable themes or styles
- [ ] Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Frontend Implementation

### UI Components
- [x] Card container
- [x] Title area
- [ ] Content area with dynamic data display
- [ ] Action buttons or links
- [ ] Loading state indicator

### Functionality
- [ ] Fetch and display real-time data
- [ ] Handle click events for navigation or actions
- [ ] Implement data refresh mechanism
- [ ] Error handling for data loading failures

## Backend Integration

### API Endpoints
- [ ] GET /api/dashboard/card-data (Fetch data for specific card types)

### Data Flow
- [ ] Fetch card data from backend based on card type
- [ ] Update card content with received data
- [ ] Handle API errors and display appropriate messages

## Testing

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for card rendering with different data types
- [ ] Integration tests for data fetching and display
- [ ] Snapshot tests for visual regression

### Backend Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for dashboard card data endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests for data aggregation (if applicable)

## Security Considerations
- [ ] Ensure proper authentication for accessing card data
- [ ] Implement data sanitization for displayed content
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all API calls

## UI/UX Suggestions
- [ ] Implement subtle hover effects for interactive elements
- [ ] Use consistent color coding for different types of metrics
- [ ] Add tooltips for complex metrics or abbreviations
- [ ] Implement skeleton loading state for better perceived performance

## Roadmap
1. Implement dynamic data loading and display
2. Add interactive elements and navigation
3. Implement data visualization features
4. Develop customizable themes and responsive design
5. Conduct user testing and iterate based on feedback

## Business Analyst Perspective
The Dashboard Card component is crucial for providing users with a quick overview of their AmazingMail account performance and activities. Prioritize the implementation of key metrics such as email open rates, click-through rates, and campaign performance. Consider adding customization options to allow users to choose which metrics they want to see on their dashboard. This will enhance user engagement and provide immediate value upon logging in.

## Dependencies
- Frontend framework (Next.js)
- State management library (e.g., Redux)
- Data visualization library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js)
- API client (e.g., Axios)

## Performance Considerations
- Implement efficient data caching to reduce API calls
- Use lazy loading for non-critical card data
- Optimize rendering of multiple cards on the dashboard
- Consider using web workers for complex data processing

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Dashboard Card component, including its current status, required features, implementation details, testing requirements, and future roadmap. It serves as a guide for developers, designers, and project managers to understand the component's scope and priorities.
