- [ ] Full functionality implementation
- [ ] Integration with backend
- [ ] Testing

## Features

### Implemented Features
- [ ] Username input field
- [ ] Email input field
- [ ] Password input field
- [ ] Confirm password input field
- [ ] Registration button

### Pending Features
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Error handling and display
- [ ] Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreement checkbox
- [ ] Email verification process
- [ ] Social registration options (Google, LinkedIn)
- [ ] CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA integration
- [ ] Password strength meter

## Frontend Implementation

### UI Components
- [ ] Responsive design for various screen sizes
- [ ] Branded logo and styling
- [ ] Loading spinner for registration process
- [ ] Password visibility toggle
- [ ] Progress indicator for multi-step registration (if applicable)

### Functionality
- [ ] Client-side input validation
- [ ] Real-time username/email availability check
- [ ] Error message display
- [ ] Redirect to email verification page or dashboard on successful registration
- [ ] Integration with authentication system

## Backend Integration

### API Endpoints
- [ ] POST /api/auth/register
  - Payload: { username, email, password }
  - Response: { user_id, verification_token }
- [ ] POST /api/auth/verify-email
  - Payload: { verification_token }

### Data Flow
- [ ] Send registration data to backend
- [ ] Handle API response (success/error)
- [ ] Trigger email verification process
- [ ] Store necessary data for authenticated session

## Testing

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for input validation
- [ ] Integration tests for API calls
- [ ] E2E tests for registration flow
- [ ] Accessibility tests (a11y)

### Backend Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for registration endpoint
- [ ] Integration tests with database
- [ ] Security tests (e.g., password hashing, email verification)
- [ ] Performance tests for concurrent registrations

## Security Considerations
- [ ] Implement HTTPS
- [ ] Protect against CSRF attacks
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for registration attempts
- [ ] Secure storage of user data
- [ ] Use strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt)
- [ ] Implement security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy)
- [ ] Prevent enumeration attacks (username/email existence)

## UI/UX Suggestions
- [ ] Implement a step-by-step registration process for complex sign-ups
- [ ] Provide clear instructions and examples for each input field
- [ ] Use inline validation with real-time feedback
- [ ] Offer password creation guidelines
- [ ] Implement a progress bar for multi-step registration
- [ ] Provide a clear path to the login page for existing users

## Roadmap
1. Implement basic registration form with client-side validation
2. Integrate with backend API for user creation
3. Implement email verification process
4. Add social registration options
5. Enhance security features (CAPTCHA, advanced password policies)
6. Optimize UX based on user feedback and analytics
7. Implement advanced features (e.g., multi-factor authentication setup)

## Business Analyst Perspective
The Registration Page is a critical touchpoint for user acquisition. A smooth, secure, and user-friendly registration process can significantly impact conversion rates and set the tone for the user's experience with AmazingMail. Prioritize a balance between security and usability, ensuring that the registration process is thorough yet not overly cumbersome. Consider implementing analytics to track registration completion rates and identify potential drop-off points in the process.

## Dependencies
- Frontend framework (Next.js)
- State management library (e.g., Redux)
- API client (e.g., Axios)
- Form validation library (e.g., Formik, Yup)
- CAPTCHA service (e.g., reCAPTCHA)

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize API calls to minimize registration time
- Implement progressive loading for multi-step registration
- Use lazy loading for non-critical components
- Optimize image assets for faster page load
- Consider using web workers for complex client-side operations

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Registration Page, including its current status, required features, implementation details, testing requirements, and future roadmap. It serves as a guide for developers, designers, and project managers to understand the component's scope and priorities.
