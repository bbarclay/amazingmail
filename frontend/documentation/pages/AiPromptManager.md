- [ ] Add a guided tour for new users

## Roadmap
1. Implement basic CRUD functionality for prompts
2. Add categorization and search features
3. Implement real-time preview functionality
4. Enhance UI/UX based on user feedback
5. Implement advanced features like prompt templates and AI fine-tuning

## Business Analyst Perspective
The AI Prompt Manager is a key differentiator for AmazingMail, enabling users to create highly personalized and effective cold emails at scale. Prioritize the core CRUD functionality first, followed by categorization and search features to improve usability as the number of prompts grows. The real-time preview feature will be crucial for user adoption, as it allows users to immediately see the impact of their prompts. Consider implementing an AI learning system that suggests improvements to prompts based on email performance data, further enhancing the value proposition of AmazingMail.

## Dependencies
- Frontend framework (Next.js)
- State management library (e.g., Redux)
- API client (e.g., Axios)
- Rich text editor for prompt creation

## Performance Considerations
- Implement pagination and lazy loading for prompt list
- Optimize API calls to minimize latency in preview generation
- Consider caching frequently used prompts for faster access

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AI Prompt Manager, including its current status, required features, implementation details, testing requirements, and future roadmap. It serves as a guide for developers, designers, and project managers to understand the component's scope and priorities.
