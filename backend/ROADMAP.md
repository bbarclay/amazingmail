## Frontend-Backend Integration Points
1. LoginPage and RegistrationPage -> Authentication endpoints
2. DashboardPage -> Campaign overview and performance metrics endpoints
3. CampaignCreationPage -> Campaign and template management endpoints
4. EmailEditorPage -> Template management and email sending endpoints
5. AnalyticsPage -> Campaign analytics and reporting endpoints

This roadmap will guide our backend development process, ensuring we cover all necessary components and align with the frontend implementation.
